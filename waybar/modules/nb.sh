# waybar custom/nb — note count for the nb notebook in $NB_DIR.
#
# waybar is started from mango's exec-once, which does not run a login shell, so
# NB_DIR from .zprofile cannot be relied on here — it is pinned below, same as
# toggle_mic.sh pins its device name.
#
# Two nb behaviours drive the awkward bits below: it colours output even when
# stdout is a pipe (hence --no-color, or the tooltip fills with escapes), and it
# reads stdin whenever stdin is not a tty (hence </dev/null, or it blocks
# forever waiting on content that never arrives).
